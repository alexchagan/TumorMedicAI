<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
 
An AI image classification project for detecting tumor in MRI images. <br />
The classifier and endpoint were created using the SageMaker AWS service and documented in the notebook file. <br />
The backend makes requests to an AWS API Gateway which uses a Lambda function to invoke the endpoint.

### Usage

This project was made for presentation purposes only since it relies on my personal AWS services.  


<!-- CREDITS -->
## Credits

Most of the backend/frontend code is open source written by Patrik Szepesi with small modifications. <br />
The usage and publishment of the code was approved by the author.
